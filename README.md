#PokeTap

Summary: Each time you tap, your Pokémon either gains XP or you take health away from the opposing Pokémon and gain XP after you beat it. Each Pokémon has its own abilities/ bonuses that unlock as you evolve your Pokémon. These bonuses are things like: more XP per tap, auto tap while logged in, auto hit rate, auto hit XP per tap. The more Pokémon you catch and evolve, the more bonuses you have, making it easier to fully evolve Pokémon. The purpose of the game is to get as many Pokémon evolved as you can.

Random Pokémon will appear based on your tap rate level or we can have different areas with different levels of Pokémon so if a player wanted to instantly try to fight Mewtwo, they could go to the cerulean cave area and try to fight him and they could beat him, it would just require tapping for days on end to actually defeat him. 
Each Pokémon you defeat will automatically be added to your Pokédex and PC. You can focus on training that specific Pokémon to help increase its bonus and help you defeat enemies quicker. 
Once a Pokémon is max level, either they are done leveling up, or you could make it where the Pokémon is “perfectly trained” and it doubles their stats completely. 
As you go along collecting Pokémon, your stats will get better and better and higher level Pokémon requiring more taps will be easier to defeat. 
Each Pokémon has a different move when you tap to defeat the opposing Pokémon. Pikachu would be using thunder every time, charizard would be using flamethrower every time. Maybe there is a way to change out the move. Each move could have a chance to do more damage or temporarily increase the damage rate or some sort of bonus like that.
